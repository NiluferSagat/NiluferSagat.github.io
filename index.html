         <p>Chess is a two-player strategy <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_game" target = "_blank">board game</a> <!-- This is anchor link, href = hyperlink reference, https...location of my file, https stands for hyper text transfer protocol secure--> played on a checkered board with 64 squares arranged in an 8×8 grid.
            <!--target blank opens up a new tab on the browser-->
            Played by millions of people worldwide, chess is believed to be derived from the Indian game <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaturanga" target = "_blank">chaturanga</a> sometime
            before the 7th century. Chaturanga is also the likely ancestor of the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_world" target = "_blank">Eastern</a> strategy games <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiangqi" target = "_blank">xiangqi</a>(Chinese
            chess), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janggi" target = "_blank">janggi</a> (Korean chess), and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi" target = "_blank">shogi</a> (Japanese chess). Chess reached Europe by the 9th century, due to the
           <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umayyad_conquest_of_Hispania" target = "_blank"> Umayyad conquest of Hispania</a> . The pieces assumed their current properties in Spain in the late 15th century, and
            the modern rules were standardized in the 19th century.

            Play involves no hidden information. Each player begins with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two
            knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. Each piece type moves differently, with the most powerful being the queen
            and the least powerful the pawn. The objective is to checkmate the opponent's king by placing it under an
            inescapable threat of capture. To this end, a player's pieces are used to attack and capture the opponent's
            pieces, while supporting one another. During the game, play typically involves exchanging pieces for the
            opponent's similar pieces, and finding and engineering opportunities to trade advantageously or to get a better
            position. In addition to checkmate, a player wins the game if the opponent resigns, or, in a timed game, runs
            out of time. There are also several ways that a game can end in a draw.

            The first generally recognized World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886. Since 1948,
            the World Championship has been regulated by the Fédération Internationale des Échecs (FIDE), the game's
            international governing body. FIDE also awards life-time master titles to skilled players, the highest of which
            is Grandmaster (GM). Many national chess organizations have a title system of their own. FIDE also organizes the
            Women's World Championship, the World Junior Championship, the World Senior Championship, the Blitz and Rapid
            World Championships, and the Chess Olympiad, a popular competition among international teams. FIDE is a member
            of the International Olympic Committee, which can be considered recognition of chess as a sport.[1] Several
            national sporting bodies (e.g. the Spanish Consejo Superior de Deportes[2]) also recognize chess as a sport.
            Chess was included in the 2006 and 2010 Asian Games. There is also a Correspondence Chess World Championship and
            a World Computer Chess Championship. Online chess has opened amateur and professional competition to a wide and
            varied group of players.

            Since the second half of the 20th century, chess engines have been programmed to play with increasing success,
            to the point where the strongest programs play at a higher level than the best human players. Since the 1990s,
            computer analysis has contributed significantly to chess theory, particularly in the endgame. The IBM computer
            Deep Blue was the first machine to overcome a reigning World Chess Champion in a match when it defeated Garry
            Kasparov in 1997. The rise of strong chess engines runnable on hand-held devices has led to increasing concern
            about cheating during tournaments.

            There are many variants of chess that utilize different rules, pieces, or boards. One of these, Fischer Random
            Chess, has gained widespread popularity and official FIDE recognition.</p>

        <p>The rules of chess are published by FIDE (Fédération Internationale des Échecs), chess's international governing
            body, in its Handbook.[3] Rules published by national governing bodies, or by unaffiliated chess organizations,
            commercial publishers, etc., may differ. FIDE's rules were most recently revised in 2018.
            By convention, chess game pieces are divided into white and black sets. Each set consists of 16 pieces: one
            king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. The pieces are set out as shown in the
            diagram and photo. The players of the sets are referred to as White and Black, respectively.

            The game is played on a square board of eight rows (called ranks, denoted 1 to 8 from bottom to top according to
            White's perspective) and eight columns (called files, denoted a to h from left to right according to White's
            perspective). The 64 squares alternate in color and are referred to as light and dark squares. The chessboard is
            placed with a light square at the right-hand corner nearest to each player. Thus, each queen starts on a square
            of its own color (the white queen on a light square; the black queen on a dark square).

        <h3 id="movement">Movement</h3>
        <p>In competitive games, the colors are allocated by the organizers; in informal games, the colors are usually decided randomly, for example by coin toss, or by one player's concealing a white and black pawn in either hand and having the opponent choose. White moves first, after which players alternate turns, moving one piece per turn (except for castling, when two pieces are moved). A piece is moved to either an unoccupied square or one occupied by an opponent's piece, which is captured and removed from play. With the sole exception of en passant, all pieces capture by moving to the square that the opponent's piece occupies.

            Moving is compulsory; it is illegal to skip a turn, even when having to move is detrimental. A player may not make any move that would put or leave the player's own king in check. If the player to move has no legal move, the game is over; the result is either checkmate (a loss for the player with no legal move) if the king is in check, or stalemate (a draw) if the king is not.
            
            Each piece has its own way of moving. In the diagrams, the dots mark the squares to which the piece can move if there are no intervening piece(s) of either color (except the knight, which leaps over any intervening pieces).
            The king moves one square in any direction. The king also has a special move called castling that involves also moving a rook.
            A rook can move any number of squares along a rank or file, but cannot leap over other pieces. Along with the king, a rook is involved during the king's castling move.
            A bishop can move any number of squares diagonally, but cannot leap over other pieces.
            The queen combines the power of a rook and bishop and can move any number of squares along a rank, file, or diagonal, but cannot leap over other pieces.
            A knight moves to any of the closest squares that are not on the same rank, file, or diagonal. (Thus the move forms an "L"-shape: two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically.) The knight is the only piece that can leap over other pieces.
            A pawn can move forward to the unoccupied square immediately in front of it on the same file, or on its first move it can advance two squares along the same file, provided both squares are unoccupied (black dots in the diagram); or the pawn can capture an opponent's piece on a square diagonally in front of it on an adjacent file, by moving to that square (black "x"s). A pawn has two special moves: the en passant capture and promotion.

        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/ChessCastlingMovie_en.svg" alt="online chess table image" width="200" height="200">
            <p>Once in every game, each king can make a special move, known as castling. Castling consists of moving the king two squares along the first rank toward a rook (that is on the player's first rank and then placing the rook on the last square that the king just crossed. Castling is permissible if the following conditions are met:[4]

                Neither the king nor the rook has previously moved during the game.
                There are no pieces between the king and the rook.
                The king cannot be in check, nor can the king pass through any square that is under attack by an enemy piece, or move to a square that would result in check. (Note that castling is permitted if the rook is under attack, or if the rook crosses an attacked square.)</p>

                <h3 id="promo">Promotion</h3>
        <p>When a pawn advances to the eighth rank, as a part of the move it is promoted and must be exchanged for the player's choice of queen, rook, bishop, or knight of the same color. Usually, the pawn is chosen to be promoted to a queen, but in some cases another piece is chosen; this is called underpromotion. In the animated diagram, the pawn on c7 can be advanced to the eighth rank and be promoted. There is no restriction on the piece promoted to, so it is possible to have more pieces of the same type than at the start of the game (e.g., two or more queens).</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h3 id="check">Check</h3>
        <p>When a king is under immediate attack by one or two of the opponent's pieces, it is said to be in check. A move in response to a check is legal only if it results in a position where the king is no longer in check. This can involve capturing the checking piece; interposing a piece between the checking piece and the king (which is possible only if the attacking piece is a queen, rook, or bishop and there is a square between it and the king); or moving the king to a square where it is not under attack. Castling is not a permissible response to a check.

            The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent; this occurs when the opponent's king is in check, and there is no legal way to remove it from attack. It is never legal for a player to make a move that puts or leaves the player's own king in check. In casual games it is common to announce "check" when putting the opponent's king in check, but this is not required by the rules of chess, and is not usually done in tournaments.</p>

        <h4 id="win">Win</h4>
        <p>Games can be won in the following ways:

            Checkmate: The player whose turn it is to move is in check and has no legal move to escape check.
            Resignation: Either player may resign, conceding the game to the opponent.[5]
            Win on time: In games with a time control, a player wins if the opponent runs out of time, even if the opponent has a superior position, as long as the player has a theoretical possibility to checkmate the opponent.
            Forfeit: A player who cheats, violates the rules, or violates the rules of conduct specified for the particular tournament, can be forfeited.
        </p>
        <h4 id="draw">Draw</h4>
        <p>There are several ways games can end in a draw:

            Draw by agreement: Draws are most commonly reached by mutual agreement between the players. The correct procedure is to verbally offer the draw, make a move, then start the opponent's clock. Traditionally, players have been allowed to agree to a draw at any point in the game, occasionally even without playing a move; in recent years efforts have been made to discourage short draws, for example by forbidding draw offers before move thirty.
            Stalemate: The player whose turn it is to move has no legal move and is not in check.
            Threefold repetition of position: This most commonly occurs when neither side is able to avoid repeating moves without incurring a disadvantage. In this situation, either player can claim a draw; this requires the players to keep a valid written record of the game so that the claim can be verified by the arbiter if challenged. The three occurrences of the position need not occur on consecutive moves for a claim to be valid. FIDE rules make no mention of perpetual check; this is merely a specific type of draw by threefold repetition.
            Fifty-move rule: If during the previous 50 moves no pawn has been moved and no capture has been made, either player can claim a draw. There are several known endgames where it is possible to force a mate but it requires more than 50 moves before a pawn move or capture is made; examples include some endgames with two knights against a pawn and some pawnless endgames such as queen against two bishops. Historically, FIDE has sometimes revised the fifty-move rule to make exceptions for these endgames, but these have since been repealed. Some correspondence chess organizations do not enforce the fifty-move rule.[note 1]
            Fivefold repetition of position: Similar to the threefold-repetition rule, but in this case neither player needs to claim the draw; thus a tournament director can intervene and declare the game to be drawn. This is a relatively recent (2014) addition to the FIDE rules.
            Seventy-five-move rule: Similar to the fifty-move rule, but as with the fivefold repetition rule, this applies independently of claims by the players, and allows a tournament director to intervene. This rule likewise is a recent addition to the FIDE rules.
            Insufficient material: If neither player has a theoretical possibility to checkmate the opponent; for example, if a player has only the king and a knight, and the opponent has only the king, checkmate is impossible and the game is drawn by this rule. On the other hand, if both players still have a knight there is a highly unlikely yet theoretical possibility of checkmate, so this rule does not apply.
            Draw on time: In games with a time control, the game is drawn if a player is out of time and the opponent has no theoretical possibility to checkmate the player.

        <h3 id="predecessor">Predecessors</h3>
        <p>Chess is believed to have originated in northwest India, in the Gupta Empire (c. 280–550),[7][8][9][10] where its early form in the 6th century was known as chaturaṅga (Sanskrit: चतुरङ्ग), literally four divisions [of the military] – infantry, cavalry, elephants, and chariotry, represented by the pieces that would evolve into the modern pawn, knight, bishop, and rook, respectively. Thence it spread eastward and westward along the Silk Road. The earliest evidence of chess is found in the nearby Sasanian Persia around 600, where the game came to be known by the name chatrang. Chatrang was taken up by the Muslim world after the Islamic conquest of Persia (633–44), where it was then named shatranj, with the pieces largely retaining their Persian names. In Spanish "shatranj" was rendered as ajedrez ("al-shatranj"), in Portuguese as xadrez, and in Greek as ζατρίκιον (zatrikion, which comes directly from the Persian chatrang),[11] but in the rest of Europe it was replaced by versions of the Persian shāh ("king"), which was familiar as an exclamation and became the English words "check" and "chess".[note 2] The word "checkmate" is derived from the Persian shāh māt ("the king is helpless").[12]

            The oldest archaeological chess artifacts, ivory pieces, were excavated in ancient Afrasiab, today's Samarkand, in Uzbekistan, central Asia, and date to about 760, with some of them possibly older. The oldest known chess manual was in Arabic and dates to 840–850, written by al-Adli ar-Rumi (800–870), a renowned Arab chess player, titled Kitab ash-shatranj (Book of the chess). This is a lost manuscript, but referenced in later works. The eastern migration of chess, into China and Southeast Asia, has even less documentation than its migration west. The first reference to Chinese chess, called xiàngqí 象棋, appears in a book entitled Xuán guaì lù 玄怪錄 ("Record of the Mysterious and Strange"), dating to about 800. Alternatively, some contend that chess arose from Chinese chess or one of its predecessors,[13] although this has been contested.[14]
            
            The game reached Western Europe and Russia by at least three routes, the earliest being in the 9th century. By the year 1000, it had spread throughout both Muslim Iberia and Latin Europe.[15] A Latin poem de scachis dated to the late 10th century has been preserved in Einsiedeln Abbey. A famous 13th-century manuscript covering shatranj, backgammon, and dice is known as the Libro de los juegos.</p>
